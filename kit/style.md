# House style for minisite copy

The audience is technical gamers who love game design and want to know how
a game works, and who are not assembly programmers. Assembly is evidence,
not the deliverable. The tone is Hacker News, not Buzzfeed: quiet,
precise, generous with the interesting detail, never breathless.

Article copy is written as a separate, final pass, after the analysis is
done. It is never produced by the same run that produced the facts. The
final pass has two steps: the draft, then a rewrite pass that applies the
rules below mechanically, paragraph by paragraph, as described in
`kit/skills/core/70-minisite`.

## What copy is for

- Explain the mechanic, then show the evidence beside it: the bytes, the
  table, the screenshot, the register.
- Lead with what a player would notice; the implementation is the
  explanation of it.
- Secrets, quirks and bugs are the best part. Give them room. The
  unintended corner case, reachable by a player who knows the code, is
  the pick of them.
- Interactivity beats description. If the reader can press it, let them.

## Rules

- Plain sentences. One idea each. Say the thing.
- Numbers go in tables, not prose, unless the number is the point.
- No hype adjectives: elegant, clever, fascinating, remarkable, brilliant,
  masterful, beautiful, ingenious. If it is clever, the explanation will
  show it.
- No stage directions to the reader: "let's dive in", "here's the thing",
  "buckle up", "spoiler alert", "in other words", "put simply".
- No rhetorical question followed by its answer.
- No "it's not X, it's Y", "not just X but Y", "more than just".
- The page title is the game's name, never a claim ("The X Is A Y").
  The standfirst, the subtitle under the title, carries the hook: the
  most interesting thing inside the game, in a sentence or two. The agent
  writes it with the rest of the copy, and the Gold pass may rewrite it
  like any other line. Section headings may carry a hook of their own;
  keep them short, and prefer the thing over the claim about the thing
  ("The landing test" over "The gauge lies").
- No tidy triplets for rhythm. Two things or four things are fine when
  there are two or four things.
- No em-dashes as the default joint between clauses. Write two sentences.
- Use the Oxford comma: a list of three or more items takes a comma before
  the final "and" or "or" ("the Doctor, a robot cat, and a mine"). The
  comma removes the doubt over whether the last two items are a pair.
- No summary paragraph that restates the section.
- Name the thing instead of "it" when the reader could mean two things.
  When a sentence opens with "it" ("It ...", "Once it is ..."), and the
  sentence before holds two or more singular nouns, replace "it" with the
  noun it stands for. Not "The hero finds the scroll in a room and takes it
  to a chamber. Once it is delivered, it gives him a power." but "... A
  delivered scroll gives the hero a power."
- Do not describe the tooling or the process ("we pointed an AI at the
  bytes"). The reader is here for the game.

### Paragraphs

A paragraph makes one point, and the reader should be able to say what it
was. Before keeping a paragraph, state its purpose in a line: "why the
villain needs the base", "how the game picks a walking frame". Then:

- Every sentence serves that purpose. A sentence that is true and
  interesting but supports a different point moves to the paragraph or
  section whose point it serves, or to Discoveries, or is cut. Interesting
  is not a reason to stay.
- The point goes first or last, never in the middle. First suits an
  explanation, so a reader who stops there still has it. Last suits a story
  or a discovery, where each sentence builds towards it.
- Each sentence flows from the one before. Open it with something the
  reader already has (the subject of the last sentence, or a word from its
  end) and end it with what is new. That puts each new fact where the next
  sentence can pick it up. If two neighbouring sentences could be swapped
  without anyone noticing, the paragraph is a list. Order them, or make it
  a list or a table.
- A pronoun has one possible antecedent. Do not open a sentence with "it"
  or "they" when the sentence before names two or more things it could
  mean. Name the thing again.
- One paragraph, one purpose. When the purpose line has an "and" in it,
  it is two paragraphs.
- The paragraph serves its page. Each tab has a purpose of its own, the
  one its subtitle states (Gameplay: what the player does; Graphics: how
  the picture is made). A paragraph whose purpose belongs to another tab
  moves there and leaves a link behind, however well it reads where it is.
  The same holds one level down: a paragraph serves its section's heading.
- Link what the page names to where it is explained. When a sentence
  mentions something another tab or section covers in depth (an object,
  a step of the solution, a routine, a map area), link those words to
  that section, not just to the tab. The reader can then dip into the
  detail from wherever they are, and the sentence stays short because the
  explanation lives in one place. The Overview most of all: its story
  and its tab list are a map of the site, so each thing they name links
  to the section that explains it.

### Links

A page has five kinds of link, and each looks different so the reader
knows where it goes before clicking.

- **Inside the site.** A plain link on the words, to the section that
  explains them (see the rule above). Link to the section, not just the tab.
- **Sources.** Where the page learnt a fact, cite it with a footnote
  marker that points to the numbered list on About, never a link in the
  sentence. The footnote's title names the source.
- **Other sites.** A link to a page outside the site that a reader may
  want to visit: a person's interview, a company's history, another
  archive. Use it on the words it is about, sparingly. site.css marks
  every such link with a small boxed arrow, so the reader knows it leaves
  the site; do not add the mark by hand. When a page outside the site is
  also where a fact came from, it is a source: give it a footnote and do
  not also link it in the sentence. A fact a reader can look up is better
  as a footnote than as a link out.
- **Places on the map.** When a sentence or a table row names a place or
  an object the Maps tab shows, put a small map-pin icon beside it that
  opens the map centred on that spot (`levels.html?go=<mark>#<section>`),
  rather than a word link or a coordinate the reader has to find. The
  icon carries a `title` and `aria-label` such as "Show the CRYSTAL on the
  map". Doctor Who and the Mines of Terror is the example: its pages
  write `map` as the link text and `reference/dw-page.js` swaps in the pin.
  Do not describe where a thing is ("halfway up on the left", "near the
  top right corner"): put the pin beside its name and let the map show it.

- **Code.** An address or a routine's name in `<code>` is a link to that
  line on the Source tab. site.js makes the link for `$XXXX` and for any
  name written exactly as the symbol map spells it (`controller_touch`),
  so write the name or address in `<code>`, never in plain text, and
  never a name the symbol map does not have.

Links are the easiest thing to leave out. Before a page is done, read it
once for nothing else: every object, creature, place, routine, and
mechanic it names, in prose and in tables, either links to where it is
explained, carries a pin, or is explained right there. A table cell is
not exempt.

The test is a human reading the page without noticing how it was made.

### Section headings

These are important as hooks for the reader – are they intrigued, do they get an immediate sense of what they can learn or play with?
Real examples:

| Original bad heading | Improved to | Why is it better? |
|-|-|-|
| Eighty minus your speed, and a zero that is always there | Secret: it's possible to land while going UP | Spell out the finding, don't be cryptic |
| The needle cannot tell you whether you are about to land | Secret: the landing gauge lets you go over - by one pixel | Spell out the finding, don't be cryptic |
| Sixteen numbers and then it stops | An uneven difficulty curve | Spell out the finding, don't be cryptic |
| A gun barrel, a gunshot, a spoken line and the credits, all driven from one interrupt | One raster interrupt runs the whole intro | The point was at the end of the list; say only that |
| Five digits, one key and one column: how the bomb is defused | The bomb code the game checks is 67134, not 32768 | The finding was in the section, not the heading |
| Codes you cannot win without, a fire that ends the level, and a reset that starts the car chase | Without its code, a section can be played but never won | Lead with the strongest finding; the others have sections of their own |
| City Hall: 75 rooms, a fire that spreads, and two ways out | City Hall, room by room | A map section names the map; the fire that wins the level earns a `Secret:` heading of its own |
| The mine: four winch parts, five digits and the detonator | Every object in the mine, in the order it is needed | Name what the section shows; a count of items is not a hook |

A heading is never an inventory. Two to four things strung together with
commas and an "and", often counted, sometimes behind a colon, and with no
verb saying what they do, list what the section contains without saying
what any of it means. The counts mean nothing until the section has
explained them, and the reader has to read all of it to learn which item
mattered. It is the rhythmic triplet from the rules above, moved into the
heading, and a margin full of them is the plainest sign that a machine
wrote the page. Pick the one thing a reader would most want to know and
say it, or name the subject plainly. A section with three findings that
each deserve a heading is three sections.

## Declare provenance

`game.json` records who wrote the copy: `agent-draft` (agent-written, no
human has read it yet), `agent` (agent-written, read by a human and left
as it was), `human-edited`, or `human`. Silver ships as `agent-draft`.
Gold means a human went through it, so Gold copy is anything but
`agent-draft`: `agent` when they read it and found nothing to change.
Human copy is preferred and always wins a disagreement. Writers who are good at this are
welcome to show it.
